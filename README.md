This is a collection of data and R scripts used in my MA-Economics thesis.  The objective is to compare time series methodologies using
the effect of oil price fluctuations on the US stock market as the testing data.  Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) tests were compared to 
SVAR tests that also implemented an instrument variable (SVAR-IV).
